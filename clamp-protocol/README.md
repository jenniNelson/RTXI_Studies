###Clamp Protocol

**Requirements:** None  
**Limitations:** None

<!--start-->
Use this module to create and run custom clamp protocols. There are three components to the module:  
1. The main window  
2. The protocol editor  
3. The protocol window  

The main window opens and runs user-defined protocols. The editor is a widget that uses the built-in protocol class to create current/voltage steps, trains, or ramps. The window overlays traces of responses to protocol stimulation.  
<!--end-->

The key features of the main window are the capacity to load/unload protocols and open the protocol editor and protocol window widgets. The module can also trigger the data recorder, meaning that when a file is already open for saving in the data recorder module, running the clamp protocol module will write data to the recorder during each trial when the protocol is running.  

![Clamp Protocol Edit UI](clamp-protocol-editor.png)

All protocols are saved in \*.csp files (which are basically XML), and contain three main components: steps, segments, and sweeps. Segments are components one level of abstraction lower than the protocol itself and comprise one or more steps. Sweeps refer to the number of times a protocol segment should be run. Protocols are loaded and edited in the protocol editor widget, displayed above, and the editor also contains a viewer. (To close the popup window, you can either right-click and close the window or hit `ESC`.)

The clamp protocol window can be used in conjunction with the oscilloscope to visualize cell responses. The protocol window will plot overlays of signals, sorted at user discretion by trial #, sweep, or run #. If you are running a large, computationally intensive protocol, you should enable the buffering option (Plot after Protocol) to avoid wasting valuable time plotting things intead of running what you need.  

####Input Channels
1. input(0) - Current In : applied current  (A)

####Output Channels
1. output(0) - Voltage Out (V w/ LJP) : voltage with liquid junction potential (V)

####Parameters
1. Interval Time - Time allocated between intervals (when running N > 1 trials)
2. Number of Trials - Number of times the loaded protocol is applied
3. Liquid Junct. Potential - Liquid junction potential (mV)

####States
1. Segment - Number of the protocol segment currently being run
2. Sweep - Sweep number in the current segment
3. Time - Elapsed time for the current trial (ms)
4. Voltage Out - Voltage w/ liquid junction potential (same as output(0)) (V)

####Comments
1. Protocol Name - Name of the loaded protocol file
